# ComplykOrt Phase 0 - Foundation Architecture

## Overview
ComplykOrt is a secure, multi-tenant compliance management platform designed to help organizations manage assessments, evidence, and regulatory requirements. This document outlines the Phase 0 foundation that provides core project management capabilities with hooks for future compliance-specific features.

## Core Principles
- **Multi-tenancy**: Complete organizational isolation with secure data boundaries
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions with least privilege
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of sensitive actions
- **Security First**: Input validation, rate limiting, and secure file handling
- **Extensible Design**: Modular architecture supporting future compliance modules

## Architecture Goals
1. Enable MVP with basic project/task management
2. Establish secure multi-tenant foundation
3. Provide clear integration points for Phase 1 compliance features
4. Support scalable user and team management
5. Deliver actionable dashboard analytics

## Technology Stack Assumptions
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI (REST API)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with tenant isolation
- **Authentication**: JWT with OIDC support
- **File Storage**: S3-compatible with signed URLs
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js SPA
- **Deployment**: Docker containers, cloud-native

## Security Architecture
- **Data Isolation**: All queries filtered by org_id
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Authorization**: RBAC with resource-level permissions  
- **File Security**: Virus scanning, hash verification, signed URLs
- **Audit Logging**: All sensitive actions tracked with actor/target/payload
- **Rate Limiting**: Auth endpoints protected against brute force

## Next Steps
This foundation enables Phase 1 compliance module integration without breaking changes to core functionality.
