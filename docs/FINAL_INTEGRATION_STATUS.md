   - Prisma ORM with type-safe queries
   - Database schema with organizations, users, projects, tasks
   - Migration system for version control

2. **🔧 Backend API Layer**  
   - Express.js server with JWT authentication
   - RESTful API endpoints for authentication and data
   - Security middleware (CORS, rate limiting, input validation)
   - Real password hashing with bcrypt
   - Multi-tenant architecture foundation

3. **🎨 Frontend Application Layer**
   - React/Next.js application with modern UI
   - TypeScript for type safety throughout
   - Authentication context and state management
   - Beautiful dark theme with glass morphism design
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

4. **🔗 Integration Layer**
   - **API Client Service** (190 lines) - HTTP client with token management
   - **Authentication Context** (143 lines) - React context for auth state
   - **Dashboard Component** (236 lines) - Real-time data display
   - **Login Modal** - Elegant authentication interface
   - **Loading States** - Professional loading indicators

## 🏗️ **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE COMPLETED**

### **📊 Data Flow:**
```
PostgreSQL Database
       ↓
   Prisma ORM
       ↓
Express.js API (JWT Auth)
       ↓
   API Client Service
       ↓
React Components (Auth Context)
       ↓
  Beautiful UI
```

### **🔐 Authentication Flow:**
```
Login Form → API Client → Backend Auth → JWT Token → 
localStorage → Automatic Headers → Protected Dashboard
```

### **🎯 API Endpoints Working:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user profile
- `GET /api/dashboard/overview` - Live dashboard data  
- `GET /health` - System health check
