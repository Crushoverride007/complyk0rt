# Session note — $(date -Iseconds)

Summary of changes today
- Fixed dev browser console noise:
  - Replaced unknown Permissions-Policy values in dev; added explicit safe policy on frontend and backend.
  - Cleaned up proxy/SSL experiments; final setup for dev: use http://95.217.190.154:3000 (frontend) and http://95.217.190.154:3001 (backend). HMR WS warning is harmless.
- Unblocked dashboard load:
  - Aligned backend /api/dashboard/overview response shape with frontend expectations.
  - Let the dashboard load even without a token in dev.
- Calendar & notes:
  - Calendar still shows prev/next month days, notes with previews, and project range overlay.
  - Project ranges now prefer startDate; fallback to created; else due-7 days.
- Assessment creation:
  - Added “Created date/time” and new “Project start date/time” to Create Assessment modal.
  - Frontend types/service now send created and startDate in POST /assessments.
  - Backend stores startDate (defaults to created/now); GET ensures both created/startDate exist.

Current dev run
- Frontend: next dev on port 3000
- Backend: simple-fresh-backend.js on port 3001

Quick commands
- Restart frontend (from frontend/):
  npm run dev -- -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
- Restart backend (from backend/):
  node simple-fresh-backend.js

Known caveats
- HMR WebSocket warnings may still appear in remote dev; safe to ignore.
- If dashboard looks stuck, hard refresh and clear localStorage auth_token once.

Next ideas / TODO (high-level)
- Optional: show created/start dates in assessment cards and details; allow sort/filter by start date.
- Optional: proxy /api via Apache for single-origin dev if needed.
- Consider realistic seed data generators for assessments/tasks/messages to better exercise the UI.
